# career-pipeline: Vision

## The Problem

Traditionally, career documentation follows a disconnected, batch workflow:

1. **Work** — You build features, solve problems, make technical decisions
2. **Recall** — Months or years later, you try to remember what you did
3. **Document** — You manually write up your experience for a CV
4. **Repeat** — Every job search, you start this painful process over

Each stage is a separate process with significant information loss between them. By the time you sit down to write your CV, the rich context of your decisions, challenges, and contributions has faded. You end up with generic descriptions that fail to convey the depth of your engineering work.

## The Solution: Continuous Career Delivery

**career-pipeline** eliminates the gap between doing the work and documenting it.

Instead of treating experience documentation as a separate, downstream task, career-pipeline integrates it directly into your development workflow — capturing structured career data as you work, building queryable knowledge continuously, and rendering polished outputs on demand.

### The Pipeline Model

```
Event → Record → Knowledge → Render
```

**Event**: Your daily engineering work — technical decisions, debugging sessions, architecture discussions, production incidents, feature implementations.

**Record**: Structured data captured in real-time. Decisions with alternatives and tradeoffs. Challenges with debugging steps and root causes. Outcomes with before/after metrics. Your specific contributions versus the team's.

**Knowledge**: A queryable database of your entire engineering career. Search by skill, technology, decision type, or challenge pattern. Connect experiences across projects and years.

**Render**: Generate CVs, prepare for interviews, identify skill gaps — all from the same source of truth, in any language or format, on demand.

### Why This Matters

- **No information loss**: Capture decisions and context while they're fresh, not months later
- **Interview-ready at all times**: Your STAR stories, technical decisions, and impact metrics are always structured and searchable
- **Continuous, not batch**: Like CI/CD transformed software delivery from periodic releases to continuous deployment, career-pipeline transforms career documentation from periodic rewrites to continuous updates
- **One source, many outputs**: The same structured data powers your Japanese CV, English resume, interview preparation, and skill analysis
